### Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Description
In this project, I used Python to understand U.S bikeshare data. I have calculated statistics and built an interactive environment where a user can choose the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

### Files used
The file containing necessary code: bikeshare.py
The data files not uploaded on the remote repo since the size is too big: chicago.csv, washington.csv, new_york_city.csv
